<p>
My name is Rui Patrick Xian, often addressed by the name Patrick. I currently work as a postdoc at the Department of Neurobiology of Northwestern University. Previously, I was employed in Germany by the Max Planck Society and have studied in China, where I also grew up, Canada, and Germany. My backgrounds are in physics, chemistry and computing. An alternative site of mine while this one is being constructed is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/rpatrickxian). I can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/RealPolitiX), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stadtkind_rpx), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jbmy4JAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-patrick-xian-04996a115/).
