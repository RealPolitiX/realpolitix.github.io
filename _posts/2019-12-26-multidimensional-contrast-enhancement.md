Contrast plays a key role in visual understanding of a scene. Contrast adjustment algorithms are often used to improve perception of image details via nonlinear intensity transforms over the pixel space. Historically, this class of algorithms are mostly devised for 2D images as they represent the majority of available images. Nowadays, methods to obtain higher-dimensional images have become increasingly common, so is the need for contrast enhancement algorithms for those images.
